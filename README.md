# Portal
A portal template created with Twitter Bootstrap for Minecraft servers

Portal is a barebones template made to rapidly create responsive portal pages for Minecraft servers. Setup is very easy, and only requires you to replace a few images, add some links, and modify a couple of padding/margin settings to get the site looking right for your icons and logo.

The template also includes floating particles with the jQuery firefly plug-in, and load animations with the animate.css library. The included logo and background are from my server, The Storm. The icons are from CraftTillDawn. The template uses Twitter Bootstrap for responsive features.

This template is very easy to edit, and only takes basic HTML/CSS knowledge.

If you need modifications done to the template I'd be happy to help, however I would ask for $10+ to do so.
